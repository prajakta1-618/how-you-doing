            Hey! I'm sorry that you're not feeling much great. It's been a rough year. I hope everyone around you is safe. 
            Take care of you and your family. Here are few things you can maybe do to make yourself feel a bit better!
        </div>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Listen to songs(Need a suggestion? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Llx2shF_Eg">Christmas Time Again</a>)</li>
            <li>Read cozy <a href="comic.html">comics.</a></li>
            <li>Learn something you always wanted to learn but couldn't find time for. It can a new language (speaking or programming), some new form of art, a new sport, anything that'll uplift your mood. 
                I learnt basics of HTML, CSS and it feels very awesome when you learn something new, however small it maybe! </li>
            <li>Don't want to do any of this? Doodle! Make repetative patterns, designs, shapes, basically anything your hand draws. It's a great exercise to soothen and calm your mind without needing any skills.</li>
            <li>Watch movies. Choose non-sad movies for starting. Or simply start watching/rewatching F.R.I.E.N.D.S. or B99. 
                From the personal experience, this is a very promising way of making yourself happy and motivated.</li>
            <li>See <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1HWme3gCuN44KMNHxnXMOEyvcxwPJVpn1">pictures of campus</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P_G5AVhz4Symjr8hzYz1BVguuidO-5oH?usp=sharing">campus pictures</a>! 
                (This might be counter-effective though. Avoid this if you were feeling sad because of nostalgia in the first place :/)</li>
            <li>Last but the most useful, talk to some close friend. Go viist him/her if possible. feel free to ping me if you don't know whom to talk to :)</li>

        </ul>
        <div class="gift">
            <p>
                For those who still don't feel much good,
                <br> you tried everything, but none of it works? Well, scroll down a bit, have a little gift you...
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cookie"><img src="images/cookie.png"></div>
        
        <div class="goback">
            <p>

                <br> Damn, did I just accidentally make you smile? Awwwww, it's even brighter now, isn't it? 
                <br><br> Congratulations! Now you're temparariely happy!! Now go back and tell me that you're doing pretty good so that I can wish you a Merry Christmas!
