            Oh hello there! If you're seeing this then that implies we're really good friends and I wanted you to have access to some random cool things I'm doing/I'll be doing here (or that someone
            just revealed this link to you, in which case eh, sure.) 
            <br> I'll try to keep this site and these pages updated throughout this year and I might also add new pages here depending on how cool my year goes. Do please let me know if case you have
            an idea about a new cool thing to try out and keep a record of here!
